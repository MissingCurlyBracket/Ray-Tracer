# Ray-Tracer

This is a fully functioning ray-tracer made with C++. It was initially made for the TU Delft, BSc Computer Science and Engineering, Computer Graphics course in 2021. A few changes have been made since then. The current version is only compatible with the Windows OS (Windows 7 and up).
